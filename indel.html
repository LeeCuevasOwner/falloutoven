            <li><strong>Heat Absorption Layer:</strong> Embedded molten salt phase-change material stores 250 kWh of excess thermal energy, releasing it gradually for stable cooking conditions.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Dynamic Positioning System</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Starting Distance:</strong> The oven is deployed 5-7 miles from ground zero, calculated through advanced simulations that factor in blast radius, thermal energy dispersion, and atmospheric variables. These parameters ensure optimal heat absorption while preserving system integrity. Because there’s no point in gourmet pizza if your oven turns to ash.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mobility System:</strong> Mounted on a reinforced high-torque robotic chassis, the oven can traverse rugged terrains and debris-filled landscapes—because the apocalypse doesn’t come with paved roads. Its mobility system integrates high-sensitivity thermal sensors with a detection threshold of ±0.5°F up to 1,500°F, GPS navigation accurate to 0.5 meters, and redundant communications to ensure uninterrupted positioning. This system remains operational even under electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events, thanks to shielded circuitry and a dedicated backup processor—because nobody wants a $10 million oven stuck in neutral.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shockwave Mitigation:</strong> Engineered with gyroscopic stabilizers capable of countering peak ground accelerations up to 5 g, the oven maintains balance through seismic disturbances and shockwave interactions. Self-adjusting leveling actuators ensure that the cooking platform stays perfectly aligned, regardless of terrain deformations caused by the blast. After all, nothing ruins pizza like uneven toppings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Autonomous Coordination:</strong> Powered by an onboard AI system, the oven processes thermal gradients, wind velocity, and seismic activity data at a computational rate of 1,000 operations per second. This allows real-time adjustments to maintain precise positioning in ever-changing environmental conditions, ensuring consistent heat exposure for cooking. Because when the ground’s shaking and radiation’s flying, precision is key.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Redundant Safety Systems:</strong> To safeguard operations, the oven’s mobility unit includes rapid deployment retractors, enabling immediate withdrawal if hazardous parameters are detected. A secondary stabilization anchor system deploys in emergencies to secure the oven against unexpected force surges or topographical instability—because your dinner deserves better than being upended by a rogue shockwave.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Advanced Thermal Management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Active Ventilation:</strong> Heat-regulating vents, controlled by an AI that probably knows more about cooking than you do, fine-tune internal temperatures with microsecond precision. These vents open and close faster than you can say "overcooked," ensuring that your gourmet pizza doesn’t end up resembling a charred relic of civilization. The system has an energy modulation accuracy of 0.1°F, because if we’re using nuclear heat, we’re not settling for guesswork.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Radiation Shielding:</strong> A multi-layered lead-composite shield blocks harmful radiation to keep your food safe and edible (as edible as post-apocalyptic pizza can be). Boron-infused polymers provide neutron absorption for that extra layer of safety—because who needs radioactive cheese pulls? Tested to reduce gamma radiation by 99.9%, this shielding is so effective it practically qualifies as overkill, but hey, better safe than glowing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Temperature Sensors:</strong> Distributed throughout the cooking chamber, these sensors provide real-time data to the AI, allowing for absolute control over every inch of your meal. Each sensor, calibrated to a precision of ±0.5°F, transmits data at a blazing 10 Hz. That’s faster than you can debate whether anchovies belong on pizza. When dealing with nuclear heat, precision isn’t just preferred—it’s survival.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
            
        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Cooking Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Energy Utilization:</strong> The oven captures and stores the immense thermal energy generated during the nuclear blast's peak (approximately 3-5 seconds), harnessing an estimated energy flux density of 500 kW/m². It’s the ultimate in sustainable energy—provided you don’t count the crater. This energy is carefully stored and redistributed for a controlled, gourmet-level cooking experience, because your pizza deserves nothing less.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Heat Distribution:</strong> Using molten salt phase-change materials capable of retaining temperatures of up to 1,022°F, the oven ensures uniform heat distribution. Think of it as the Tesla of ovens: over-engineered, futuristic, and perfect for showing off to your post-apocalyptic neighbors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Breadsticks First:</strong> As any true chef will tell you, breadsticks are the foundation of a good meal. The oven prioritizes these carb-loaded delights, cooking them for the first 10-12 minutes to achieve that perfect balance of crispiness and fluffiness. Even in the apocalypse, we have standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Then the Pizza:</strong> Once the breadsticks are done, the oven shifts focus to the pizza, maintaining a precise temperature of 425°F (218°C) for 15 minutes. The result? A crust that’s crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and strong enough to hold whatever questionable toppings survived the fallout.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Final Results:</strong> The entire process is managed by an AI chef with more multitasking skills than your average human. From balancing thermal fluctuations to ensuring even heat distribution, the system guarantees every bite is perfection. Because when you’re cooking under extreme conditions, “close enough” simply isn’t good enough.
